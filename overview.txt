OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
	Developed within 24 hours, our blockchain based application is a success for everyone in itself regardless of the position we take.
This this age where technolgies like AI and Machine Learning is flourishing, Blockchain, despite all its promising outcomes, lacks some pace
behind them. In our application, the user interacts with the system as a phone based app(developed using java) and the admin interacts as a 
web based app. The main concept of our app is to create a LFC (Life Coin) like reward for people's involvement in voluntary activities. An 
organization like SOS can use the app to collect volunteers from the locality and later reward them with LFC which equivalents to a certain
real life amount and symbolises a good cause. Due to the use of blockchain concept, the overall process is totally transparent, secure and trustable.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
	The Smart contract was written in Solidity and was deployed in the local blockchain via Remix IDE. The test nodes used for the testing of our ERC token implemented 
functions (transfer(),balanceOf(),totalSupply()) were locally created using the Ganache platform and these nodes were then imported in the MeteMask to support 
the functions defined in our MyCoin implementation of ERC20 token. Web3 is a JS library used to access the nodes via node.js.
